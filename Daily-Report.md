# 📘 2. Track Reflection

### **a. What I learned overall**
I learned the fundamentals of React, including how components work, how to pass props, and how to manage state using the useState hook.  
I also learned how to render lists with .map(), how to update arrays without mutating them, and how parent and child components communicate through function props.  
Another important skill I learned was how to upload a complete project correctly to GitHub.

---

### **b. What I struggled with**
I struggled with understanding how functions are passed from the parent component to the child and how the child can update the parent’s state.  
I also had difficulty with reordering tasks (move up/down), handling time input correctly, and uploading folders like src and public to GitHub.  
These challenges helped me understand React more deeply.

### **c. What I’m proud of**
I’m proud that I successfully built a complete Daily Planner application with many features, including adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, reordering tasks, and adding time.  
I’m also proud that I structured my project well with components and uploaded everything properly to GitHub.  
This project gave me real confidence in my React skills.

### **d. What I’ll improve next week**
Next week I want to improve my understanding of React hooks such as useEffect and learn more about state management.  
I also want to improve my UI design skills, write cleaner code with comments, and practice more with Git and GitHub.  
I plan to build more small projects to strengthen my React knowledge.
